# Learning Deep Learning with TensorFlow

This repo contains the notebooks and notes and certain study materials I am using to learn **Deep Learning from scratch**.
Repo will be updated as I learn.

All of the course materials from the [Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow course](https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse).

>  **Built and end to end CNN Food Image Classifier. Check it out : [**Food Vision**](https://github.com/gauravreddy08/food-vision)**

## Contents of this page

**[Notebooks](https://github.com/gauravreddy08/deep-learning-tensorflow/#notebooks)**: all the notebooks I code while learning the course

**[Projects 🛠](https://github.com/gauravreddy08/deep-learning-tensorflow/#projects-)**: projects I do on inbuilt mini data-sets and few large data-sets

**[log ](https://github.com/gauravreddy08/deep-learning-tensorflow/#log-spiral_notepad)**:spiral_notepad: : updates, changes and progress

**[to-do ](https://github.com/gauravreddy08/deep-learning-tensorflow/#to-do-dart)**:dart: : there's still more to-do !

## Projects 🛠

- [x] 🛩️ Regression using [kaggles-insurance-forecast](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) dataset.

- [x] 🛩️ Multi-class Classification using [keras fashion_mnist](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) dataset.

- [x] :rocket: [**Food Vision**](https://github.com/gauravreddy08/food-vision) using CNN's.

- [ ] :rocket: Skimlit : NLP.

- [ ] :rocket: BitPredict.
