# Learning Deep Learning with TensorFlow

This repo contains the notebooks and notes and certain study materials I am using to learn **Deep Learning from scratch**.

 They will be updated as I learn.

All of the course materials for the [Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow course](https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse).

## Contents of this page
