# Learning Deep Learning with TensorFlow

This repo contains the notebooks and notes and certain study materials I am using to learn **Deep Learning from scratch**.

> This Repo will be updated as I learn.

All of the course materials from the [Zero to Mastery Deep Learning with TensorFlow course](https://dbourke.link/ZTMTFcourse).

## Contents of this page

[Notebooks](https://github.com/gauravreddy08/deep-learning-tensorflow/#notebooks) : all the notebooks I code while learning the course

[Projects 🛠](https://github.com/gauravreddy08/deep-learning-tensorflow/#projects-): projects I do on few inbuilt mini data-sets and few large data-sets

[log ](https://github.com/gauravreddy08/deep-learning-tensorflow/#log-spiral_notepad):spiral_notepad: : updates, changes and progress

[to-do ](https://github.com/gauravreddy08/deep-learning-tensorflow/#to-do-dart):dart: : there's still more to-do !

## Projects 🛠

- [x] 🛩️ Regression using [kaggles-insurance-forecast](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) dataset.

- [x] 🛩️ Multi-class Classification using [keras fashion_mnist](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) dataset.

- [ ] :rocket: Food Vision using CNN's.

## log :spiral_notepad:

* 09 May 2021 - Created the repository, uploaded all the available baseline notebooks
* 20 May 2021 - Added Computer Vision and CNN Notebooks
* 21 May 2021 - Added `helper_function.py` in extras/ folder

## to-do :dart:

- [x] Add all the base line notebooks
- [x] Create a basic README File
- [ ] Polish all the Notebooks

- [ ] Update the Notebooks and README with notebook summaries
- [x] Probably create a new folder for misc resources
